The following scenario applies to the next 1 items,"1600: Client reports increased blood pressure readings while at home, stating, 'I take it every day, and over the past week, it has been running about 165/95 mm Hg.' The client reports full adherence to his prescribed antihypertensive medication, which includes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. The client notes he has been increasingly anxious about several work projects and 'cannot turn my mind off.' He says he cannot fall asleep and only gets 5-6 hours of sleep per night. He reports that the anxiety and inability to sleep started three weeks ago. He denies any recent illness. Upon assessment, the client appears tired and is completely oriented.

2a). You should notice mood improvement within 5 to 7 days.
3b). See emergency care for a persistent, painful erection","Clonidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist and is indicated in the treatment of hypertension. The medication may be administered as a pill or transdermal patch for seven days. Clonidine should not be abruptly discontinued because of the risk of rebound hypertension due to a catecholamine surge. Clonidine has a sedative effect, and the client should not take this medication with alcohol or while driving/performing tasks requiring a high degree of concentration. An example of a calcium channel blocker would be diltiazem or nifedipine. An example of an aldosterone receptor antagonist would be spironolactone.

Sertraline is a potent, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Sertraline is indicated in treating anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and depressive disorders. In this client, it is likely the sertraline is being used for the client's anxiety. This medication has a favorable cardiac side-effect profile and is aptly prescribed for this client. SSRIs take four to six weeks to gain efficacy. A new medication may be attempted if no efficacy is observed in twelve weeks. Most SSRIs cause a decrease in libido and sexual performance. This may be a temporary effect. SSRIs typically cause gastrointestinal distress once they are started and may be lessened by taking the medication with food. This effect generally resolves on its own. An example of an atypical antipsychotic would be aripiprazole or ziprasidone. An example of a tricyclic antidepressant would be doxepin or nortriptyline.

Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic indicated in the treatment of insomnia. Zolpidem has a rapid onset and should be taken immediately before the planned bedtime. Falls are a significant concern with this medication, especially for older adults. Another consideration is suicidality, as zolpidem has precipitated clients to experience suicidality. This medication should not be taken with alcohol or other CNS depressants because of the risk of respiratory depression. An example of a benzodiazepine would be alprazolam or diazepam. An example of an anticonvulsant would be topiramate or phenytoin. A persistent, painful erection (priapism) should be reported for trazodone - not zolpidem.",Medium,3/6,4 mins,Pharmcology,Psychiatric Medications,"Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapie
